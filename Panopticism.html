      <h2>The Digital Panopticon</h2>
      <p>
        <br> Foucault highlights the problematic idea of the panopticon, drawing 
        relation from the structure made for prisons to surveillance and domination 
        in the outside world. Foucault’s analysis is important in respect of today’s 
        digital age. Any action on the internet poses the risk of privacy invasion 
        at the click of a button, making monitoring of populations easier than ever before. 
        Increased growth of new technology means an increased interconnectedness with one another 
        at the risk of undermining self-determination. It forces us to question the role of panopticism 
        in today’s digital landscape. </br><br> Foucault’s analysis is emblematic 
        of an overarching theme in the digital world, where surveillance techniques are continually 
        expanding and mutating to increase control of populations. He writes “… the major effect of 
        the Panopticon: to induce… a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the 
        automatic functioning of power “(Foucault 6). The Panopticon, a large tower like structure
        in the middle of the prison, was constructed to keep watch over prisoners. After time the
        tower will need not be manned due to the self-regulation that it instills, the constant 
        fear if being watched maintains the prisoner’s behavior even in the lack of an 
        actual guard being in the tower. This is strikingly like modern online surveillance 
        techniques. </br>
        <img src = "panopticon.jpg" alt="Panopticon diagram" class="Image">
        <br> A great example is social media. Platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram,
         and Twitter, employ techniques to regulate how users interact with one another. 
         Users are constantly reminded that their interactions, posts, and actions are 
         being monitored through things like business metrics. Snapchat and Instagram 
         have story views, so the user can directly see who views their posts/stories. 
         This feature deters certain users from viewing stories in fear of being called 
         out for their behavior, even though there is no guarantee that a user will see a 
         certain individual viewed their story. Other visibility metrics including likes, 
         comments, and shares create a constant sense of observation and scrutiny of users. </br>
        <br> Foucault writes “… the Panopticon was also a laboratory; it could be used 
        as a machine to carry out experiments, to alter behaviour, to train or correct 
        individuals” (Foucault 8). The panopticon was welded to alter behavior, not to 
        just regulate it. This idea is integral to the survival of the digital world. 
        Users must alter their behaviors online to deter the invasion of their privacy 
        by dominating powers. Social media platforms use visibility metrics to incentivize 
        users to act differently in order to increase views, likes, comments. This alters 
        the ways in which the user interacts with the platform; while not entirely 
        bad, this form of surveillance is wielded to maximize use of social media platforms. </br>
        <img src = "surveillance.jpg" alt="Social media surveillance" class = "Image">
        <br> Even though social media surveillance techniques are prevalent in the 
        modern social landscape, writer Tim Rayner argues that social media can be a 
        way for users to shape their own subjectivity. He writes “When we seize on a 
        moment and ‘package’ it in the form of a 140-digit tweet, we do more than 
        just create an item of content to share with our friends. We hone our view on 
        the world, and in the process, define ourselves as persons, identities, and subjects” 
        (Rayner). This in a sense becomes liberatory in a way that is unachievable in many
         social communication forums. As users we share, like, and repost content that fits 
         our personal views and aids in processing ourselves as subjects within the broader 
         scheme of society. </br>
        <br> A second example of surveillance that remains prevalent in the digital 
        world, is government surveillance programs. Mass surveillance initiatives 
        involve the monitoring of online communications. Citizens are unaware of the 
        full extent to which the government intrudes on their online presence, but the 
        looking fear of surveillance deters certain activities. </br>
        <br> Countries around the world are participating in surveillance programs
         that regulate their citizens. An article by Freedom House describes 
         “Authorities in Iran have boasted of a 42,000-strong army of volunteers 
         who monitor online speech… Similarly, the ruling Communist Party in China 
         has recruited thousands of individuals to sift through the internet and 
         report problematic content and accounts to authorities. (Shahbaz and Funk). 
         As Shahbaz and Funk detail, there is a prevalent domination at play. Users 
         in countries fear being reported for their online presence. Semptian, a Chinese tech 
         firm has boasted its Aegis surveillance system wields the capacity to “store 
         and analyze unlimited data.” Claiming to be monitoring over 200 million
          individuals in China. There is a constant state of ruling over online individuals
           and countries are starting to wield the Virtual Panopticon to
            regulate interactions through all forms of internet usage. As 
            technology grows, the means through which individuals are regulated
             online will only mutate and become more aggressive to ensure they 
             abide by principles higher beings set forth. </br>
        <br> In the digital landscape, Foucault's insights on surveillance offer a
         poignant lens through which to examine the pervasive nature of control in
          online spaces. The realization that every digital action carries the 
          potential for regulation, often unbeknownst to the user, underscores the profound 
          impact of technology on our autonomy. As our interconnected world continues 
          to evolve, this system of control becomes increasingly potent, transcending 
          geographical boundaries. The growth of technology brings with it not only 
          opportunities for connectivity but also challenges to individual privacy and 
          autonomy. It prompts us to critically assess the delicate balance between the
          benefits of technological progress and the imperative to safeguard personal 
          agency in an era where digital actions are subject to unseen forms of scrutiny
          and regulation. </br>
